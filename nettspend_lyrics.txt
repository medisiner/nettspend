Pour up for my brother, your lean don't even make me high
You get me high, you get me high, it don't even get me
Xan got me high enough to fuck your main bitch
She said I'm going dumb, but I won't cum, who you think I am?

I'm going M.I.A, my friends gon' think I'm fuckin' (Shh)
I'm in the trap, boost the trap for my fuckin' mans
And it's a ritual we do, so you cannot get in
And you can't get it in with me, you gon' have to pay a fee
I told my bitch to hold my strap
I told my bitch to hold my strap, 'cause she was next to me
I told my brother Zuro, we ain't finna go for free
I'm looking at the sky, thinking 'bout how high it go
I'm thinking 'bout the bitches, thinking 'bout how tall they be
I'm fuckin' with these model bitches, I swear they all some freaks

I don't give no fucks 'bout what you have to say (Yeah)
It's Nett, I don't shoot below the neck

In the backend, worry about the flex
It's a lot of money, so I wanna flex
There's a lot things that I wanna do, but I don't wanna screw over you
I wanna make you feel good in a room
Like two hoes clutchin' on a tool
In a bank, and I will hold it up for you
Go guns blazin' all over you
In the club, fucked up, off a pill or two
Yeah, I'm really missin' you, long live my brothers
I ain't talkin' 'bout a bitch, can't miss no bitch
At the top, so lit, you at the bottom, down bad
And I'm lookin' like a lick but I ain't no lick
Keep that Glock on my hip, Gen 5
And I ain't afraid to shoot this bitch, ain't afraid of your tricks

I'm with my brothers doing drugs in the trap house
I'm with my brothers doing shrooms in a witch house
Stolen pole that I'm grippin' when I crash out

Diamonds on my neck, Activis up in my cup
Diamonds on my neck, A-Activis up in my cup
DJ PHAT up in the spot, that boy gon' pour me up
Bad hoe, but I told her that she lookin' rough
I said my cut look rough around the edges, cut me up
And a bitch so goth, told me to cut her up
I'm not the runner-up, I'm up in first, I'm running up
I'm running up that bag, for my momma and for my cuz'
I'm in the same spot, looking for the stolen love
She got some cool tattoos, but she look dumb as fuck
Bad fat butt bitch, smack her on her ass (
smack her on her ass, smack her on her

[Verse 2]
DJ PHAT up in the spot, that boy gon' pour me up

That boy lame, he still ride the bus
Fuck school, I still play with toolies
Beat his ass up 'bout a check, money that you talkin' to
Yeah, I'm 'bout to dub you, like, who you think you talkin' too?
I seen a red balloon, I'm like IT up in a sewer, dude
She a bad bitch and she know who she talkin' to
Outside of the show she wanna fuck, let's take it to the room
Outside of the show, it's hella cameras on me and my dudes
Dude, I said, "Fuck a deal", I'ma crash out
Put that boy up in a fuckin' meal
Take a Xan, forgot, like, what I said, and I still can't feel
Can't feel, I got a feelin' I'm goin' up

Got a feelin' I'm goin' up (Up, up, up, up)
Still can't feel, I got a feelin' I'm goin' up, goin' up

Lyrics from 
Snippet
[Chorus]
Go, go, go, go
Drugs in my dream, I fell asleep
And they love what they see, like, get close to me
Surf Gang at the beach, It's so much weed I broke the leaf
I'm O.T.O, be off the opioids, I swear I get too geeked
Make me, make me, make me evil
Turns out that this bitch a treesh
I double up the loose leaf, and I can't even feel the weed
I feel like Future but Gen Z
Put some molly in her teeth
Baby, tell me what you need
You might be fuckd up, but not like me (Fuck)
Me, M, Two, Three, One, Three
Date night molly
Fell in love with sleep
And my brothers said this shit ain't no jealousy
They just envy

Swag, swag, that you never had

I was just in the club

2 UP 2 DOWN Lyrics
[Verse]
Yeah, I love my brother [?]
Told him, "Watch out for the feds"
Finna take a fuckin' trip
Witch Gang up in this bitch
Told him, "Watch out for the stick, that bitch in rotation"
I just rolled another blunt, the first one in rotation
I watched you jack the fuckin' swag and put it in rotation, bitch
I'll take a flight across the map before you fuckin' take it from me
You watched me grow up in VA, so why you tryna take it from me?
Talkin' on the fuckin' 'net, get smacked up in your fuckin' face
Why you talkin' on the Mack? As you know him, phreshboyswag
Yeah, that's my brother, preshboyswag, yeah
We gon' swerve up on the block, [?] ain't got no tags
Zuro keep a MAC and this is not no GTA
You would think this was some cap but you ain't seen the way I was raised
That's why we raisin' all the hell and I'm gon' fuck her in her face (Gang)
Bitch tryna eat up off my plate
That's why we goin' up and you ain't think that I was the one
So you throwin' up but you ain't think this was no shit
So we up
Back against the wall in a nosebleed
I got the Glock up on me, I ain't scared to fuckin' show it
I got yo' bitch around the way and she gon' fuckin' show 'em
I hit your phone, I'm around yo' way but you ain't fuckin' know it
I hit your phone, I'm around yo' way and she gon' fuckin' throw it

Out the whip Lyrics
[Hook: Kasper Gem]
Can you water me, I'm running out of stamina
Can't put my legs down, you know how I stand up
I don't wanna beg
I don't wanna make you feel strange
I don't wanna turn into strangers
Turn into stranger
I don't wanna turn into strangers
I don't wanna turn into strangers
[Verse: Kasper Gem]
I don't wanna hurt this way
So I guess I gotta learn the game
Cover up my name in dirt
It's okay, cover my face when you flirt with me
Babe, name you call me at a work time
I don't wanna call, I don't wanna facetime
I don't wanna keep it back and forth, it's waste time
I don't know all that you had, it's still for me, I'm tryna find
I'm draggin' my body across the floor, baby I'm tryna find
[Hook: Kasper Gem]
Can you water me, I'm running out of stamina
Can't put my legs down, you know how I stand up
I don't wanna beg
I don't wanna make you feel strange
I don't wanna turn into strangers

make me sick Lyrics
[Verse 1: ilycider]
Bitch get me mad, she getting kicked out
They keep looking at my fit, I brought the Ricks out
Slap that hoe across the face and pull my dick out
I smoke too much in a day, boy, that's the fifth ounce
All my niggas be some bloodhounds
I use that bitch face to put my fucking blunt out
Punch that nigga in the face if he bug out
So lil' nigga, please, don't bug out
Sippin' purple, nigga, yeah, I'm feeling wavy
Purple shit in my cup got me lazy
And that bitch say I'm cute like a baby
I can't fuck with niggas if they crybabies
And I'ma love you, if you my lady
A nigga got a lot of fuckin' ladies
Don't fuck with that hoe 'cause she got rabies
When I retire I'm the GOAT like Tom Brady
When I retire, nigga, I'ma still be killin' shit
12 pull me over, nigga, I'ma plead the fifth
This bitch dumb as hell if she think that I'm serious
Yeah, I ride for my niggas, I lie to my bitch

Fridge full of straight pints of Actavis

Um, we're a study group

Uh, yeah

Don't know what she doin' but she doin' it good
And I'm so proud of that bitch 'cause that bitch on my wee
And that bitch touched my wood
Swear to God, she suck me up so good, I was cummin'

Brought a Glock in that bitch, swear to God, I'm so strong

Whippin' drugs in the club, swear to God, ugh
Only drive with my pill, pill-pill
Off a thrill, shit got me ill-ill

You can't have this, you can't have what I'm stuntin'
I won't stop fuck a jump 'till we Spyro
Why you eatin' dick, bruh? That's a bad sign, uh
Why you tryna see what I'm on?
And you actin' like a bitch but claimin' that you hard
I be in my room, rappin' like a car

Don't know what she doin' but she doin' it good
And I'm so proud of that bitch 'cause that bitch on my wee
And that bitch touched my wood
Swear to God, she sucked me up so good, I was cummin'
Comin' in on that bitch, goin' skrong
Brought a Glock in that bitch, swear to God, I'm so strong
Tried to play me, are you fuckin' new?
Whippin' drugs in th club, swear to God, ugh
Only drive with my pill, pill-pill
Off a thrill, shit got me ill-ill
All thse grown bitches jumpin' on my cock

Fall in love wit stupid hoes I'm on the fuckin brink
Can't get that shit off my mind, I get high til' I can't blink
And a slut gon' be a slut cuz that's the only thing she think
